# Python-200days-leetcode

Gonna (atleast) try to maintain 200 days streak of solving Python problems from Leetcode.

## Rules
 - Atleast do 1 problem daily for 200 days
 - Problems can be of any level, but will try my best.
 - Can take a few days off, but reasons must be justified.
 - README needs to be updated WEEKLY

Happy Coding :)
